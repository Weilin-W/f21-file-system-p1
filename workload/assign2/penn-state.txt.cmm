Centre County became the site of the new college in response to a gift of 200
acres from gentleman farmer and ironmaster James Irvin of Bellefonte. Founding
President Evan Pugh drew on the scientific education he had received in Europe
to plan a curriculum that combined theoretical studies with practical
applications.

Pugh and similar visionaries in other states championed Congressional passage
of the Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1862. The act enabled states to sell federal
land, invest the proceeds, and use the income to support colleges "where the
leading object shall be, without excluding scientific and classical studies ...
to teach agriculture and the mechanic arts [engineering] ... in order to
promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in all
the pursuits and professions of life." The state legislature designated Penn
State the land-grant institution of Pennsylvania.
